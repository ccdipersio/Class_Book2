<b>Class_Book2</b> is the Java component of my coding sample for my University of Washington application for the masterâ€™s degree program in Computational Linguistics.

The program runs in a terminal and keeps track of a class's grades and students. Upon loading the program, it will ask for a default or custom record file. For the sake of demonstration, it's probably best to just let the program load the default one. That file is housed in the parent director of <i>/src/com/ccdipersio</i>. For that reason, it's absolutely necessary to grab <i>record.txt</i> along with the entire <i>/src/com/ccdipersio</i> folder and keep them organized in the same layout as seen in this repository.
